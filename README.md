## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview

The objective of this project was the analysis of the Trenord Station graph based on the graph theory. The analysis was developed in two directions: the first referred to the robustness and resilience, rather the capacity to resist to the falls of some nodes; the other one referred to the load of the network, in term of number of trains that pass though every station.
